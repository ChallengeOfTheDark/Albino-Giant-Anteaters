# Albino-Giant-Anteaters (updated for Planet Zoo 1.6)

This mod makes the light brown-red brown erythristic giant anteaters white, giving them a more major difference in color from the regular ones that are more subtly different from the regular ones. Works with Planet Zoo 1.6
The icons aren't updated to reflect the changes yet, but if players want it I can add them in the future :)
Please let me know if you encounter any bugs or issues so I can squash them. 

**Note: this mod only replaces the textures of the albino (erythristic) anteaters, not the regular ones.** 

## How to install: 
-Backup original folders from `steamapps\common\Planet Zoo\win64\ovldata\Content2\Animals\Aardvarks\Giant_Anteater`     and place them somewhere you can find them. 

-Unzip the folders in this mod and add the ones you wish to the "Giant_Anteater" folder from your Planet Zoo Content2 folder, overwriting existing files if prompted. 

-Done! Enjoy! :) 

If you'd like only one anteater to be replaced, the male, female or juvenile, you can download just the file you want.

**_I update my mods within the first three days of a Planet Zoo update. If that doesn't happen it means I don't have internet and will update as soon as I get it. 
Please do not update my mods. I will do it myself._**
